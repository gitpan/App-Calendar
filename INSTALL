CalendarApp.pm - Web based calendar.

System requirements:

1.  Perl version 5.005 or greater.
2.  Apache Web Server with modcgi.
3.  The Perl Date::Calc library module from www.cpan.org.
4.  GNU make.


Installation:

1.  Unpack the source archive:

      tar zxvf App-Calendar-<version>.tar.gz
	
    or:

      gzip -dc App-Calendar-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -

2.  Change to the top-level subdirectory:

      $ cd App-Calendar-<version>

3.  Edit the CalendarApp.pm script with the domain name of 
    the Web server and the duration that the browser should
    maintain the app's cookies.  The default is 15 minutes
    ('+15m').  The CGI.pm documentation ('man CGI') describes
    how to specify cookie duration.

4.  The top-level Makefile should work on any Unix or derivative
    system.  It uses the host system's Perl installation to 
    build the package Makefiles.  At the prompt, type:

      $ perl Makefile.PL

5.  Build the program modules and documentation.  Type:

      $ make

6.  If necessary, become root (via "su", for example), and 
    install the source files and documentation in the system's 
    site_perl library, and the "browser" script in 
    /usr/local/bin, using the "make install" command:

      $ su
      Enter Password:
      # make install

7.  Install the calendar.cgi script in the server's CGI
    script directory.

8.  Add a HTML tag to the web page that contains the link
    to the calendar.cgi script:

      <a href="cgi-bin/calendar.cgi">Calendar</a>
